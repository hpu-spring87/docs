The Z shell (zsh) is a **Unix shell**. Zsh can be thought of as an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of bash, ksh, and tcsh. It offers many advantages such as:
- Efficiency
- Improved tab completion
- Improved globbing (specify sets of filename with wildcard characters)
- Improved array handling
- Full customisability

**Paul Falstad** wrote the first version of zsh in 1990 while a student at Princeton University
