# Overview
Mathematics terminology

# Scalar
Scalars are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (or numerical value) alone.

# Vector
Vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and a direction.

# Rate of change
Rate of change play a role whenever we study the relationship between two changing quantities. Velocity is a familiar example (the rate of change of position with respect to time)

## Average rate of change
The average rate of change of y=f(x) over an interval [x0,x1]:

Average rate of change = [f(x1) - f(x0)] / [x1 - x0]

> Average rate of change is the slope of the secant line through the points (x0,f(x0)) and (x1,f(x1)) on the graph of f(x)

## Instantaneous rate of change
Instantaneous rate of change is limit of the average rates of change.

> Instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent line at x0.

# Tangent lines
You can think of a tangent line as a line that skims a curve at a point.

# Secant lines
The term secant line refers to a line through two points on a curve.

# Geometry
study of shape

# Algebra
study of operations and their application to solving equations

# Calculus
study of change

# Limit
Suppose that f(x) is defined for all x in an open interval containing c (but not necessarily at x = c). Then

	lim f(x) as x approaches c equal L

if for all epsilon > 0, there exist delta > 0 such that

	|f(x) - L| < epsilon if 0 < |x - c| < delta

> Intuitively, when x approaches c then f(x) approaches L.

# Differential calculus
finding tangent lines to curves

# Integral calculus
computing areas under curves

# Cartesian coordinate
A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.

# Homogeneous coordinate
Homogeneous coordinates are a system of coordinates used iin projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry.

# Unit circle
A unit circle is a circle with a radius of one. In trigonometry, the unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane.

# Hypotenuse
In geometry, a hypotenuse is the longest side of a right-angled triangle, the side opposite of the right angle.

# Trigonometric identities
Trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric functions and are true for every single value of the occurring variables where both sides of the equality are defined.

# Asymptote
An asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity.

# Piecewise function
f(x) = 5 if x < 0
f(x) = 6x + 7 if x = 0
f(x) = 7x if x >0

A function with definition as above is a piecewise function.
