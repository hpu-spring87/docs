# Overview
All about productivity. How to do everything with the best productivity.

# Time Management
1. Stop multi-tasking, It merely kills your focus.
2. Set up work routine and stick to it.
3. We're  always more focused and productive with limited time.
4. Break task into the chunks. And start with short chunk to rolling the ball.
5. Always prioritize.
6. If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate!
7. Set deadlines for everything. Don't let task go on indefinitely.
8. Write down anything that distracts you - Google searches, random thoughts, new ideas, whatever. The point is, if you write them down, they'll stop bubbling up when you're in the zone.

# Relieving stress
Writing down your thoughts with structure:
- **Context** (Hoan canh): easy part, write anything spawn in your brain, about weather, about your feelings, about small things, etc.
- **Problems** (Van de): specify all your problem, which you stuck with it. Use bullet at begin of line.
- **Solutions** (Giai phap): thinking and find solution for each problem, hardest part.
- **TODO** list: specify all things your must do right now and sort follow priority.
